..::About the project::..

A website were you can find the top 20 flight tickets in eco class from where you want to where you want, when you want.

Hope you like it and give me and my group some feedback.

We use the momondoapi from https://github.com/5ms/Momondo-API/tree/master/php and got the values from the console to html, with some mysql insert to a database where we have all the dates we searched.

Kind regards, ACA Group.
